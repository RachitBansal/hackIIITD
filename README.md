## Our repo with our implementations from HackIIITD

### Hope you have as much fun going through them and experimenting with them as we had when making.

:)
=======

# We have 2 Main Components

- App
- Server Logic

## For Running the app:

`cd ccs`

and then run

`flutter run`

Make sure flutter sdk and required dependencies are already installed.

## For running the backend logic:

Please setup a GCP project with Dialogflow and Firestore enabled

And then use Python to run the `firebase_app` and `flask2.py` for their respective roles.
